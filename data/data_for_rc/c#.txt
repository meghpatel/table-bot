C# (pronounced as \"see sharp\") is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure. \n\nC# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 7.0, which was released in 2017 along with Visual Studio 2017. \n\nThe ECMA standard lists these design goals for C#: \n\nDuring the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system called \"Simple Managed C\" (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for \"C-like Object Oriented Language\". Microsoft had considered keeping the name \"Cool\" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.unknown"
